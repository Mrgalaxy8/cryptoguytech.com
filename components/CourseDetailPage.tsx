                    Blockchain technology is one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. It powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its potential extends far beyond digital money. At its core, blockchain is a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to record transactions. This document provides a beginner-friendly overview of how blockchain works, its key components, and real-world applications.

                <Section title="1. What is Blockchain?">
                    <p>A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data cannot be altered retroactively. Each block contains a list of transactions, and once it is verified, it becomes part of a chain of blocks — hence the term "blockchain."</p>
                    <p><strong className="text-green-400">Real-world Example:</strong> Imagine a Google Sheet shared across hundreds of users. Everyone can see the latest entries, but no one can delete or modify old data without the approval of the entire network. That's how blockchain maintains transparency and trust.</p>
                </Section>

                <Section title="2. Key Features of Blockchain">
                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Decentralization</strong> – No single entity controls the blockchain; it's maintained by a network of nodes (computers).</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Transparency</strong> – Every participant can view transactions recorded on the blockchain.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Security</strong> – Cryptography ensures transactions are secure and tamper-proof.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Immutability</strong> – Once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Consensus Mechanism</strong> – The network agrees on which transactions are valid before adding them to the chain.</li>
                    </ol>
                </Section>

                <Section title="3. How Blockchain Works">
                    <p>Every blockchain operates on a simple process: 1. A transaction is requested. 2. The transaction is broadcast to a network of nodes. 3. The nodes validate the transaction using consensus algorithms. 4. The validated transaction is added to a new block. 5. The new block is appended to the existing chain. 6. The transaction is complete, and records are updated across all nodes.</p>
                    <p><strong className="text-green-400">Example:</strong> When Alice sends 1 Bitcoin to Bob, the transaction is verified by thousands of computers on the Bitcoin network. Once validated, it becomes part of the blockchain — permanently recorded and visible to anyone.</p>

                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Public Blockchain</strong> – Open to everyone (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Private Blockchain</strong> – Restricted access, controlled by one organization (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric).</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Consortium Blockchain</strong> – A hybrid managed by multiple organizations (e.g., Energy Web Foundation).</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-white">Hybrid Blockchain</strong> – Combines both public and private features for controlled transparency.</li>
